Abstract: Facial expressions plays a vital role in communicating various emotions that we can’t express directly. But Sometimes people misunderstood our emotions or can’t recognize the emotion which we want to convey by our expressions. So, Machine can help us in recognizing the face expressions using human-to-machine interaction technology. To make this task simpler for smooth communication we have used artificial intelligence to classify human emotions into seven different categories like happy, sad, fear, neutral, angry, surprise and disgust. In this paper, we reviewed the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) pretrained architecture AlexNet and AlexNet with SVM and we used FER2013 (Facial Emotion Recognition) dataset which is having approx. 35000 facial RGB images of different seven categories. After training FER2013 using two different algorithms AlexNet and AlexNet with SVM the best accuracy we got is 0.6158. After training the trained model is tested in the real time by capturing the video from webcam and by uploading face image of a people with a random emotion.
